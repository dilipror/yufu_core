Dear Interpreter,

As far as you hadn’t reconfirmed your accessibility, your order was cancelled.

Please pay attention that each order that hadn’t been reconfirmed, has a negative impact on your

reputation as an interpreter.

Next time if you cannot perform your job, please let us know in advance.

Thank you for cooperation!
